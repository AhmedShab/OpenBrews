# OpenBrews
A cross-platform open source app to help you brew.

The goal of our first release is to provide a 100% free and modern alternative
to the brewing software currently being used. This will be in the form of two
iOS and Android applications.

Down the line, I would like to have an Web App and an API that allows
persistance of recipes across devices, public sharing of recipes, and more!

## Developers
This app is built using [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/), which is
built on AngularJS. If you have no idea what Ionic is, and only know AngularJS,
you'll probably be fine. We are also leveraging Ionic CSS (rather than
Bootstrap (for now). Other than that, the project uses GULP, Bower, and SCSS.

In the future I hope to add an API to support synchronization across devices and
sharing of recipes.

Anybody is welcome to contribute to OpenBrews. Just check the issues and Project
boards for current bugs and tasks. When you're ready to start working, fork the
project, code a little, and submit your PR. If you end up contributing regularly,
I can add you as a contributor to this repository.

To run the app, clone this repository, `cd` into the repository folder, and run
`gulp && ionic serve [--lab]`.
