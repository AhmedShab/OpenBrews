# OpenBrews
A cross-platform open source app to help you brew.

The goal of our first release is to provide a 100% free and modern alternative
to the brewing software currently being used. This will be in the form of two
iOS and Android applications.

Down the line, I would like to have an Web App and an API that allows
persistance of recipes across devices, public sharing of recipes, and more!

## Developers
Anybody is welcome to contribute to OpenBrews. Just check the issues for
current bugs and feature requests, code a little, and submit your PR.

To run the app, clone this repository, `cd` into the repository folder, and run
`gulp && ionic serve [--lab]`.
